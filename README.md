# Re-Wordle

A project to share your Wordles in a new, creative way. Once you have finished your wordle, you can share your guessing pattern using Re-Wordle, and allow your friends to de-construct your guesses. Fun, right? Well I'll find out if I ever complete it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works
The way I envision this, for the future (to be clear), is that once you finish your wordle for the day, you can generate a re-wordle based on it. This re-wordle is just your guesses, with all but the last one obscured by the same rules that Wordle uses. The last word will be treated as a "solution", and the colour coding will be in accordance with your guesses. You would then be able to share a link to your re-wordle with your friends, whereby they can guess your guesses. 

For each of the words to guess, the guesser would get 3 strikes. Any time they find a letter that's correct, it will be updated in the grid. The objective of the game, much like wordle, is to guess all the words given.
